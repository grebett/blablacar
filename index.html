								Hello BlaBlaCar staff!
							</p>
							<p>
								My name is Grégory Betton, I am a computer science student from 42 school and I've met you during your last afterwork.
							</p>
							<p>
								I've been immediatly seduced by your spirit and your values and, after considering your job offers, I've decided to apply!
							</p>
							<p>
								Although I could have given you a simple resume, I've prefered to build for you this quick website, not as a technical demo,
								but because it seemed to me the best way to explain why we should work together.
							</p>
							<p>
								I won't bother you with my personal details, as you may have already got them in the recruitment form. Please feel free to browse the different
								categories of this website. If there is any question I haven't answered for now, let's keep in touch.
								I'll be very pleased to talk with you!

								Some say that passion is quite like an engine. But, to my mind, passion is rather a sort of fuel. You can run out of it, but you still can refill it to travel a few more miles. Passion is deeply linked to curiosity. As long as there are new horizons to explore, new things to learn and more people to discover, passion will keep our spirits awaken!

								I do have a lot of crazy ideas. Some will never be born, and this makes me sad, but I've already tried a lot of cool things. The last project I've started mixes literature, erotism and web. I designed the whole concept, built the platform and found my first authors. If you're curious about it, it'll be a pleasure to show it to you.

								You must have some ego. Underestimate yourself is a one-way ticket to inaction. Nevertheless, ego does not mean	 vanity or despise. I pity arrogant people, who think they have to show off to prove their intelligence. Reality needs you to work as a team and to accept concession.

								Ok. This one is THE one. Could I have an A3 version of it I could pin above my desk? I'm found of learning, by myself, and with others. The first thing I loved when I discovered programming is the sharing community. Some say about me I can be a good teacher too. I've been teaching first aid for the French Red Cross and programming for children with Bibliothèque sans Frontière's «code voyagers».

								Do you like your boss? Sometimes, decisions have to be made and democracy in a company is not always viable. But who will you listen to? I personnaly accept decisions that are out of my hand when I respect the leader who tells me what to do. When I take my medecine, it's because I have trust in the doctor's abilities. When I follow an order from someone, it's because I recognize his experience and legitimacy. Members are the boss, because they are the ones that make your project alive. But are they good bosses?

			<div class="page" id="tech">
				<h1>What about my tech stack?</h1>
				<p>
					I do apply for a frontend engineer job, yet, I like to define myself as a fullstack web developer. Javascript addict, I'm curious about other languages and have practised a few. Let me present you my tech stack.
				</p>

				<div class="techs">
					<!-- vanilla JS -->

							<p class="middle-centered">
								JavaScript mon amour! This language has had a very strange life. Everyone was despising it as a language just good for script kiddies. And then jQuery happened. And Node.js. And all of a sudden, JavaScript became cool! Today, you can't imagine the web without it. And if you stick to the good parts (which are more and more numerous as the new ES versions come out), JavaScript is the power tool you have to masterize.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- angularJS 1.x -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col m8">
							<p class="middle-centered">
								I do like vanillaJS, and try to stick to it instead of using jQuery. Yet, I'm not a JS extremist who loves to write each piece of its own code by hand. The web today is a place to share little blocks to build bigger ones. Very interested in frameworks that endorse these vision, I've worked a lot with angularJS 1.x and, none of the less, its directives. A whole ecosystem for single page applications, but also cross-platform mobile ones!

							<img src="http://grebett.github.io/blablacar/img/polymer.png">
						</div>
						<div class="col m8">
							<p class="middle-centered">
								Lately, I have discovered Polymer. Polymer is not a framework. It's a library (written by Google Chrome devs) wrapping the web components. This concept is, to me, the next revolution in web development. Imagine a container composed of an HTML template, a script and a stylesheet. This container is independant, has no effect on other containers except its children. You now have a reusable, easy to develop, little component. A small brick which just waits to be assembled with its numerous siblings!
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- node.js -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col m8">
							<p class="middle-centered">
								I know, this is not the official logo of Node. But heh, design matters. I've started programming with node during my first year of school. It was not taught in any project, but I found the principle amazing. Now, Node.js has become a must have for a lot of usages, and is the basis of numeros dev tools (as you may know since you are using Grunt). JavaScript outside the browser, who saw that coming?

						<div class="col m8">
							<p class="middle-centered">
								You may say: «Well, JavaScript is fun, but I want a real language for real backend programming.» I heard you. Why don't have a look on go language (golang) ? First of all, the gopher looks a lot like your Mascot. First good point. Then, this language is maybe one of the most mordern, easy to use and efficient language I've encountered (Geeks I know still try to make me learn Rust). Golang is the illegitimate child of Python and C. Hard typing, but interpolation. Error checking first. Concurrency. Safe pointers. Very fast compilation... I won't say more, just have a look if you haven't already or check out my github golang repositories.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- C -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col m8">
							<p class="middle-centered">
								In 42 school, we start learning programming with C language. Well, that's not exactly true. We don't really use the language itself, but only its core. Not a single function from the standard library allowed, we have to recode everything from scratch. Imagine using your own printf? This way of learning has its advantages, and algorithms, unix calls and functions prototypes have no more secret for us.

						<div class="col m8">
							<p class="middle-centered">
								Lately, I've been curious about Machine Learning (especially Deep Learning). It's quite the premices so I won't say I masterize it at all. Yet, in order to use Tensor Flow (the open source Deep Learning library released by Google), I've start to learn Python. I can't wait to look forward and see how far this new field can lead us!
